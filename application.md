          <h2>Cold Application<br /></h2>
          Belform Interlocking System is ideal for underground piping applications, cold work applications, 
            and for piping along bridges, roofs, and towers, etc.
          A combination of Belform Styrofoam SM with a waterproof jacket, such as MFM Subseal #40 or #60, is the perfect fit. 
            If the piping is exposed to the weather, 
            stainless steel or aluminum jacket is required.

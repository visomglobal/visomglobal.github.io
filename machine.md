<br><p>Belform Insulation’s state-of-the art CNC machining systems give us industry leading capabilities, with large format high speed foam machining. With in-house CAD/CAM services, using MasterCam, we can design models for you in 3D and manufacture them quickly, or you can provide us with a CAD model of the items you need made.</p>

<p>Belform’s Custom Developed CNC Machining Systems were designed and built by us, for us,  because nobody knows the needs of the foam machining industry like Belform does. With over 30 years of foam manufacturing experience, we custom built these machines to our specifications, to provide us with the optimal tools to be the leaders in the foam machining industry.</p>
<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3 >NEW!  5 Axis CNC Router</h3>

With a giant working capacity of  10 feet x 7 feet x 3 feet depth. Custom built by us in-house, to our own specifications, specially equipped for high-speed 3D foam machining capable of machining the largest size of foam stock available. Belform can make very large 3D one-piece models, making installation and finishing faster.

<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3>Robotic Milling Arm</h3>

With a large dynamic working capacity.  Belform’s  Robotic Milling Arm can be set up in multiple configurations to suit the task at hand. Belform uses the most advanced robotic simulation software, which allows us to program the robot to manufacture complex 3D shapes.

<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3>3-Axis CNC Router</h3>

With a large working capacity of 10 feet x 5 feet x 10 inches deep. Custom built in-house, to our own specifications, specially designed for high-speed 2.5D machining. Belform’s 3 Axis CNC Router is ideal for complex one-sided 2.5D machining of large stock with a maximum height of 18 inches.

<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3>PLASMA CUTTING CNC </h3>

With a working capacity of 10 feet x 6 feet, our in-house custom built Plasma Cutting CNC has the ability to cut any shape out of flat metal stock metal up to 1″ thick.  Belform can make any 2D shape, quickly on this robust high-speed Plasma Cutting CNC.

<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3>Profile Cutting CNC</h3>

With a working capacity of 8 feet x 6 feet x 4 feet depth, our braided wire Profile Cutting CNC can machine rigid foams of any density into complex 2D shapes, quickly and precisely, with the ability to machine multiple blocks at once.

<br><i class="icon solid fa-check-square"></i><h3>Hotwire CNC</h3>

With a working capacity of 8 feet x 6 feet x 4 feet depth, our Hotwire CNC can machine EPS-expanded polystyrene, XPS-extruded polystyrene, polymethacrylimide low density rigid foam, flexible expanded polypropylene foam, polyethylene foam, of any density into complex 2D shapes.

Belform is able to manufacture an array of foams, to make any 3D shape you may need.  Some of the foams available are,  ESP,  XPS, EPP, Urethane Foam, Cellular Foam, and Phenolic Foam,  each available in many different densities.

Belform can also machine rigid plastics, ABS, PLA,  and medium-density fiberboard. Belfrom can machine mostly anything from non-ferrous materials, contact us for details.

`Biggest one piece Elbows in the market`

Angle Valves can be manufactured from several materials including: 2.2 lb. and 5 lb. Phenolic 2lb and 4lb, `Urethane` Dow SM extruded Polystyrene Foamglas. `STYROFOAM brand insulation` has no food value to attract or support plant or animal life. 

Exposure to direct sunlight for extended periods of time can result in ultra-violet degradation of the surface. Signs of UV degradation are a yellowing of the surface, followed by the formation of a thin layer of dust. This dust can inhibit the bonding of mastic coatings and sealants, and it should be removed by thoroughly brushing before application of such materials. 

STYROFOAM brand insulation has excellent resistance to acids, bases, brines and alcohol. It has poor resistance to `hydrocarbons`, olefins, ketones and vinyl esters. More comprehensive resistance charts are available upon request.
